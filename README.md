# HomelyWeb

Homely is an online shared task manager for roommates to have a central location to see chores, supplies, and payments. 

## Running the site locally
production runs on https://homely-web.netlify.app, but locally, you can run the site by following the steps below

* clone the git repository by running the command `git clone https://github.com/Umar-M-Haroon/HomelyWeb.git`
* cd in the folder by running `cd HomelyWeb`
* create an .env file with the following keys

- REACT_APP_API_KEY
- REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN
- REACT_APP_DATABASE_URL
- REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID
- REACT_APP_STORAGE_BUCKET
- REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
- REACT_APP_APP_ID
- REACT_APP_MEASUREMENT_ID
- FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:8080

these keys would need to be generated by building your own firebase app and extracting the keys from the settings

### running the emulator
The website also has an emulator for local database hosting, but this runs with multiple other steps and is not guaranteed to work on other firebase apps. The best approach at the moment is to remove lines 32-37 on firebase.js

## testing the site locally
this would need the emulator to run, but if that works, run `npm run test`
